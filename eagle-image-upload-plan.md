# Plan: Implement Image Upload via Eagle API for Obsidian Eagle Plugin

## 1. Overview of current state related to the feature

- `obsidian-eagle-plugin` now has a clean, minimal settings UI using Obsidian's built-in components
- Eagle API connection is working and tested (confirmed via curl to localhost:41595)
- UI follows toss-frontend-rules with minimal complexity and maximum use of native components
- All unnecessary component files and advanced settings have been removed

## 2. Overview of the final state of the feature

- `obsidian-eagle-plugin` uploads images from clipboard, drag-and-drop, and canvas to Eagle via the Eagle Plugin API
- User interaction: simple upload confirmation dialog, progress feedback, error handling
- Clean settings UI with connection test, Eagle API URL, and basic upload preferences

## 3. List of all files to change with text description

### âœ… **COMPLETED - Basic Plugin Structure & Settings**

- `src/main.ts` - Main plugin file with health check and settings
- `src/types/plugin.ts` - Simplified settings interface (single URL field)
- `src/types/eagle.ts` - Eagle API response types
- `src/eagle/EagleClient.ts` - Simplified API client with minimal logging
- `src/ui/EagleSettingsTab.ts` - Clean settings UI using native Obsidian components
- `styles.css` - Minimal styling
- `manifest.json` - Plugin metadata

### ðŸ”„ **NEXT - Image Upload Implementation**

- `src/uploader/ImageUploader.ts` - Core image upload logic
- `src/ui/UploadModal.ts` - Simple upload confirmation modal
- `src/utils/ImageDetection.ts` - Detect image operations in Obsidian

### ðŸ“‹ **FUTURE - Image Upload Features**

## 5. Current Status

**âœ… PHASE 1 COMPLETE** - UI optimized and simplified!

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Simplified API Connection**: Single URL field instead of separate host + port
2. **Clean Settings UI**: Connection test at top, removed unnecessary sections
3. **Native Components**: Using only Obsidian's built-in Setting components
4. **Minimal Complexity**: Removed all custom component files and excessive abstraction
5. **Reduced Logging**: Clean, minimal error messages
6. **File Structure**: Cleaned up to essential files only

### Current File Structure:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ eagle/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ EagleClient.ts          # Simplified API client
â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ eagle.ts               # API response types
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugin.ts              # Simplified settings
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ EagleSettingsTab.ts    # Clean settings using native components
â””â”€â”€ main.ts                    # Main plugin file
```

**Next:** Ready to implement Phase 2 - Core image upload functionality!
