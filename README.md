- `src/uploader/` - Image upload logic and factory pattern
- `src/ui/` - User interface components (settings, modals)
- `src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions for file handling

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **"Cannot connect to Eagle app"**

   - Ensure Eagle app is running
   - Check API URL and port settings
   - Verify Eagle version (1.11 Build21+ required)

2. **Wrong Port Number**

   - Default Eagle API port is 41595
   - Check Eagle settings if using custom port

3. **Network Issues**
   - Eagle API only works locally (localhost)
   - Check firewall settings if necessary

### Upload Issues

1. **Images not uploading**

   - Verify "Enable image upload" is turned on in settings
   - Check that Eagle app is running and accessible
   - Ensure vault path is correctly configured

2. **Temporary files not cleaned up**
   - Check `.eagle-temp` folder in your vault
   - Manually delete temporary files if needed
