## Code Organization

The plugin follows a clean, modular architecture:

- `src/eagle/EagleClient.ts` - Eagle API communication
- `src/uploader/` - Image upload logic and factory pattern
- `src/ui/` - User interface components (settings, modals)
- `src/types/` - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions for file handling

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **"Cannot connect to Eagle app"**

   - Ensure Eagle app is running
   - Verify Eagle version (1.11 Build21+ required)
   - Eagle API runs on port 41595 by default

2. **Network Issues**
   - Eagle API only works locally (localhost)
   - Check firewall settings if necessary

### Upload Issues

1. **Images not uploading**

   - Check that Eagle app is running and accessible
   - Ensure vault path is correctly configured in settings
   - Verify upload confirmation is not blocking the process

2. **Temporary files not cleaned up**
   - Check `.eagle-temp` folder in your vault
   - Manually delete temporary files if needed
